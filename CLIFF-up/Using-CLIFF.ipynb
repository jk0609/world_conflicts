    "MIT's [CLIFF](http://cliff.mediameter.org/) is a piece of software for extracting geolocation data from text, bundled into a server that can be accessed via API calls. I've bundled CLIFF into a Vagrant virtual machine for people (like me) who aren't thrilled about learning how to set up Tomcat servers and get Java configurations right. See the [CLIFF-up repo on Github](https://github.com/c4fcm/CLIFF-up) for the code to get CLIFF running easily inside a Vagrant virtual machine. Follow the instructions there to get CLIFF-up and then come back here for a walkthough of how to use CLIFF once it's running.\n",
